<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<p>You will need to login using Ion in order to use Director.</p>
<p>After students login for the first time, they will get an opportunity to create a personal website in the format https://user.tjhsst.edu/&lt;username&gt;. Students can do this by pressing the Create Webdocs button in the upper right corner.</p>
<p>The dashboard contains a list of sites that you have access to. You can click a particular site to see more details about it. You can use the search bar on the top of the page to filter the list of sites. Below are a few examples of search queries:</p>
<ul>
    <li>To find sites with the word "testing" in their name or description:<br /><span class="search-example">testing</span></li>
    <li>To find sites with a PostgreSQL database:<br /><span class="search-example">tag:postgresql</span></li>
    <li>To find sites without a Git repository:<br /><span class="search-example">notag:git</span></li>
    <li>To find PHP sites with a SQL database:<br /><span class="search-example">PHP tag:sql</span></li>
    <li>To find activity sites with "tech" in their name or description:<span class="search-example">type:activity tech</span></li>
</ul>
<p>After you have clicked a site, you will see information about the site and options to modify it.</p>
<p>To upload files to your website, you can use a tool like <a href="https://winscp.net/">WinSCP</a> to connect to <span class="path">remote.tjhsst.edu</span>. You will then need to change directories to the location specified on the left of the page.</p>
<p>You can also use the online editor or web terminal to edit your site. You can access these features through the "File Explorer" and "Web Terminal" buttons on the left of the page.</p>
<p>The <span class="path">public</span> folder is where the server will serve files from (in static and PHP sites). As a good first step, you will probably want to make a <span class="path">public/index.html</span> file.</p>
<p>The <span class="path">private</span> folder is where logs are generated (ex: the PHP error log). This folder is not accessible to the public.</p>
<p>If you create a <span class="path">.secure</span> file in a folder, that folder will be only accessible to you after a login. If you add a <span class="path">.index</span> file to a folder, the folder will list all of its contents when you navigate to it.</p>
<h5>Custom Domains</h5>
<p>You can use a custom domain for your site by clicking on "Edit Site" and adding your domain to the domain field. You will then need to set up a CNAME record to point your domain to <span class="path">sites.tjhsst.edu</span>.</p>
<h4 name="editor">Online Editor</h4>
<p>Double click files and folders to open them. You can right click files in folders in the Files tab, or right click the blank space in the Files tab for more options. Clicking a file will open up the file for editing. Drag files on to the Files tab in order to upload them. You can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + Click or <kbd>Shift</kbd> + Click to select multiple files.</p>
<p>You can drag and drop files and folders to move them to different folders. You can drag around tabs to reorder them and create new panels. Your editor layout will automatically save if you make any changes.</p>
<p>If you open a preview panel, it will automatically refresh when you edit the associated file in the editor.</p>
<p>The Nginx tab is not editable for security reasons. If you want to make a change, ask a sysadmin.</p>
<h4>Dynamic Sites</h4>
<p>To use a custom server, such as Django or Node.js, you will have to change your site type to Dynamic{% if site %} (it is currently <b>{{ site.get_category_display }}</b>){% endif %}. You will then need to create a script file in any directory and {% if site %}<a href="{% url 'edit_process' site.id %}">{% endif %}set the Director process to this script file{% if site %}</a>{% endif %}.</p>
<h5>Node.js Server</h5>
<div class="step">
    <p>Put the following file in the public folder and name it <span class="path">server.js</span>.</p>
    <b class="file"> public/server.js</b>
    <pre><code class="javascript">var http = require('http');

var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
    res.end("It works! Path: " + req.url);
});

server.listen(process.env.PORT, function() {
    console.log("Server listening on: " + process.env.PORT);
});</code></pre>
    <p>Put the <span class="path">run.sh</span> file in the root directory, use <span class="path">chmod +x run.sh</span> to mark it as executable, and set the Director process to this script file.</p>
    <b class="file"> run.sh</b>
    <pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/sh

node server.js</code></pre>
</div>
<h5>Django Server</h5>
<div class="step">
    <p>Run <span class="path">django-admin startproject server</span> in the <span class="path">public</span> folder.</p>
    <p>Put the <span class="path">run.sh</span> file in the root directory, use <span class="path">chmod +x run.sh</span> to mark it as executable, and set the Director process to this script file.</p>
    <b class="file"> run.sh</b>
    <pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash

cd server
gunicorn server.wsgi -b 127.0.0.1:$PORT -w=4</code></pre>

@app.route("/")
def index():
    return "Hello World!"</code></pre>
    <p>Put the <span class="path">run.sh</span> file in the root directory, use <span class="path">chmod +x run.sh</span> to mark it as executable, and set the Director process to this script file.</p>
    <b class="file"> run.sh</b>
    <pre><code class="bash">#!/bin/bash

gunicorn server:app -b 127.0.0.1:$PORT -w=4</code></pre>
